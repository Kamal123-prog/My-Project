California.It currently consists of lead vocalist Adam Levine, keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Jesse Carmichael, 
bassist Mickey Madden, lead guitarist James Valentine, drummer Matt Flynn, keyboardist PJ Morton, and multi-instrumentalist
 Sam Farrar. Original members Levine, Carmichael, Madden, and drummer Ryan Dusick first came together as Kara's Flowers 
in 1994, while they were still in high school. After self-releasing their independent album We Like Digging?,
 the band signed to Reprise Records and released the album The Fourth World in 1997. 
The album garnered a tepid response, after which the record label dropped the band and the members focused on college.
 In 2001, the band re-emerged as Maroon 5, pursuing a different direction and adding guitarist Valentine.
The band signed with Octone Records, an independent record label with a separate joint venture relationship with J Records and released their debut album Songs About Jane in June 2002. Aided by its lead single, "Harder to Breathe",
 which received heavy airplay, the album peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 chart,and went platinum in 2004.</b></font></p>
